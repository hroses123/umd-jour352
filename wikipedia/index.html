<h2>Title</h2>
<p>The title phrase "girl in a plain brown wrapper" has a multiple meaning. It is used on page 214 of the first edition referring to the body of one of the female characters who was wrapped heavy brown paper to conceal her identity as McGee continues his investigation, and also alludes to a brown-skinned African-American hotel maid who gives vital assistance to McGee. At the time of the novel's publication, a package being delivered in a plain brown wrapper was also understood as implying erotic, illegal or potentially embarrassing material.[1]
The McGee novels all had colors in their titles, a mnemonic device Macdonald invented to help readers recall which books in the series they had read</p>
